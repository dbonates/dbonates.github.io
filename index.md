This was my first contact with eLearning Market. And my job generate content for training products. Using web tools and programming languages, I was responsable for create technology and apply them on eLearning platforms, known as Learning Management Systems (LMS for short). For years I've worked with the topmost LMS's like Moodle and Sabba, for example. Also, many times I was in charge to customize these solutions bringing new functionality to them, or create software to integrate with them, like an Offline Course Player for Scorm, which runs on small computers on OffShores.
